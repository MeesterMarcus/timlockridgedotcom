Today, University of Minnesota Press launched [Manifold](https://manifoldapp.org):

> Manifold Scholarship is an open-source publishing platform that enables authors and publishers a means to showcase and enhance the electronic content they already produce in their existing workflows: texts are displayed in a responsive, elegant reader crafted for all modern browsers and devices—desktop and mobile.

I haven't had a chance to look through the source code yet, but Manifold appears to be built with Javascript, Node, & Ruby On Rails. If so, Manifold could be an incredible resource for academic publishing—assuming that presses can find (and afford) staff to deploy and maintain the software.
