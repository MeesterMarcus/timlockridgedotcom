<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

I am currently working on three major research projects: an archival study of *2600: The Hacker Quarterly*, a series of case studies about writers & writing technologies, and the development of an electronic publishing lab at Miami University. For a list of recent publications, please refer to my [CV](/../cv).
