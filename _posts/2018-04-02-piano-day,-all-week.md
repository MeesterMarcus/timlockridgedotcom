Nils Frahm's "[Piano Day](http://www.pianoday.org)" aligns with the start of spring, and his annual playlist provides much of my working music for April. This year's playlist has nine hours of music, and it includes a number of my favorite contemporary composers (including Sophie Hutchings, Library Tapes, and Bruno Sanfilippo) as well as several new tracks from artists on the stellar [1631 Recordings](https://1631recordings.bandcamp.com). Listen, listen.
