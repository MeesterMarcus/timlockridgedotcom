As we near the start of the academic year, I've been reflecting on my summer. Some things of note:

- Derek & I received the 2018 Sweetland/University of Michigan Press Book Prize for our manuscript *Writing Workflows: Beyond Word Processing*. There's a nice [announcement on the Sweetland site](http://www.digitalrhetoriccollaborative.org/2018/07/26/sweetland-um-press-book-prize-awarded-to-tim-lockridge-and-derek-van-ittersum/).
- I also received the [Michelle Kendrick Outstanding Digital Production/Scholarship Award](http://candcblog.org/computersandcomposition/awards/digital.htm) on behalf of Computers & Composition Digital Press. We've put a lot of work into the press, so it's truly a honor to receive recognition from the field.

Speaking of the press, two things of note:

- We finally released [the site redesign](http://ccdigitalpress.org), after a full year of coding, writing, and revising it. Much of this work happened between and around teaching and research obligationsâ€”which means the evenings & the weekends. [Statamic](https://statamic.com) donated a license to the press, and we are grateful for that. There are still parts of the site that I plan on adding and changing, but it's a good start.
- We also published three books this summer: *Racial Shorthand*, *Making Future Matters*, and *Soundwriting Pedagogies*. Like most academic projects, these were all years-in-the-making, so it's a pleasure to see them published and finding an audience.
