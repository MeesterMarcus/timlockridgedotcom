I'm looking forward to Frank Turner's upcoming album, *Be More Kind*, and this song—the title track—has offered me a bit of solace in an otherwise difficult political and cultural moment.

In my teaching, I often talk about generosity: Of assuming the best of others, of working toward shared goals, of valuing collaboration and service more than personal gain. But I think Frank Turner says it much more simply: "Be more kind, my friends, try to be more kind."
