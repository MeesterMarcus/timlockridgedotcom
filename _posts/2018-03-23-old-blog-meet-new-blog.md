I'm moving all of my new blog posts to this url (/blog) so that I can maintain my personal website and a simple blog with a single Jekyll installation. Here's hoping it motivates me to stay on top of things. I still see a fair number of hits to my old posts, so I'm keeping the old blog intact and archived at the blog.timlockridge.com subdomain.
